## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is TGOpti safe to use?**  
A: Yes! All scripts are open-source and transparent. We recommend reviewing them and creating a system restore point before applying optimizations.

**Q: Will this void my warranty?**  
A: No. TGOpti only modifies software settings, not hardware or firmware.

**Q: Can I undo the changes?**  
A: Absolutely! Use the built-in "System Restore" button or Windows' native System Restore feature to revert all changes.

**Q: Do I need to run this regularly?**  
A: No. Most optimizations are one-time tweaks. You may want to run "Clean Temporary Files" monthly for the best result.

**Q: Will this break Windows Updates?**  
A: No. TGOpti doesn't disable Windows Update or essential system services.

**Q: Why do I need .NET Runtime?**  
A: The GUI application is built with .NET for a modern, responsive interface. The batch scripts themselves don't require it.

**Q: Does this work on laptops?**  
A: Yes, but be cautious with "Disable All Power Saving Features" as it may reduce battery life.

**Q: Can I use this on a gaming PC?**  
A: Absolutely! TGOpti is optimized for gaming performance with reduced input lag and better frame stability.
